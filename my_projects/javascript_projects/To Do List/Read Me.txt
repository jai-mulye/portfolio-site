This is a To Do list made with HTML, CSS(Bootstrap) and JavaScript.

The user can add tasks and when submitted, it creates a new div with one li and two buttons. The user can mark a task as done and also undo the marking. Task can be removed from the list by clicking on remove button.
Bootstrap is used to layout the elements and some custom CSS for sytling. JavaScript part of the project uses EventListeners and DOM Manupulation to add or remove tasks.
