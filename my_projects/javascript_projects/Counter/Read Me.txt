This is a Simple Counter made using JavaScript.

The counter is initially set to 0. The counter can be incremented or decremented by one each time and color of the number changes depending on if the number is positive or negetive. The counter can also be reset to zero. 

The counter uses EventListeners and DOM Manupulation to change the color depending upon the value of the counter.
