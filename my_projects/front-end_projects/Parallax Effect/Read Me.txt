Parallax Effect is a visual effect that occurs when the user scrolls through the content of the web page. It is generally coupled with background images that keep changing. The core principle of this effect lies in the css property (background-attachment: fixed;)

To demonstrate the effect, I have made a site on Seven Wonders of the World containing images and text.
